### BEtoEAC_numbers_2020_Gut.R
-R script to reproduce model predictions provided in manuscript Results including:
## Primary outcome: Model-predicted EAC cases in year 2010, ages 40-90
## Secondary outcome: Model-predicted BE cases in year 2010
-Also provides code to reproduce model-predictions for Figure 3, Figure S1, and Figure S2
